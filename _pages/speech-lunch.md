Welcome to the Speech Lunch (formerly Sphinx Lunch) at Carnegie Mellon University!
This lunch meeting is designed to discuss any speech-related research items regularly.
The meeting consists of presentations by CMU faculties, CMU students, and guest speakers.
We welcome any reserach topics, including an ordinary presentation, conference presentation rehearsals, preliminary research ideas, research discussions, and so on.
We also welcome any CMU researchers and external researchers to join the meeting.

During the semester, we will regularly have meetings in the following slots:

- Date: Thursday 12:30 pm - 1:30 pm
- Room: GHC 6501

The time and room may change, especially if we have a guest speaker.
We will announce the talk information through our [mailing list](https://mailman.srv.cs.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/sphinxmail). Approval by the admin is required.
So, please subscribe to it if you're interested in the CMU speech!

Please contact Shikhar Bharadwaj (sbharad2@andrew.cmu.edu) and Shinji Watanabe (shinjiw@ieee.org) if you would like to participate in our Speech Lunch.
